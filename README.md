## Usage Instructions

To use the bot, place a file named `Token.txt` in the
same directory as the `Main.py` file.

The music module requires a `Temp` folder in the same
directory as the `Main.py` file, this is where downloaded
`.mp3` files will be downloaded. the bot will not clean this
folder to prevent unreasonable wait times when requesting
songs for download from spotify.
